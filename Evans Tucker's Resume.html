<div class="headline">Biography</div>
<span>Evans Tucker is an American systems administrator, best known for some brief company-wide outage, but occasionally recognized for his elegant code and excellent process documentation. The most notable companies he has worked for are: Charles Schwab, Indeed, and his current employer, athenahealth. In 2015, he and his family sold almost everything they owned, and moved from Austin, Texas to Portland, Oregon to escape the heat, mosquitoes, and ennui. Evans is a strong advocate for Linux, free/libre open source software, autonomous electric cars, space colonization, and some kind of post-scarcity economics world where work is optional, and we can just sit around philosophizing all day long.</span>
    <div class="headline">Experience</div>
<div class="left">Senior Member of Technical Staff at <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">athenahealth, Inc.</a> (Remote/Telecommute)</div>
<div class="right">2015-08-31 to Present<span class="years" data-start-date="2015-08-31" data-end-date=""></span></div>
<div class="clear">
      <p>For most of 2016, I was part of a small team that was creating a new platform in AWS. I built custom CentOS 7 and Oracle Linux 7 images using Packer, then we used SparkleFormation - an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that builds CloudFormation templates - to build ELBs, ASGs, and other BS. We set up GitLab to house all of the code, and used Puppet 4 with Hiera as our ENC to manage configuration.</p>
      <p>App deploys, OS upgrades, developer requests, and on-call issues were another significant part of my workload. App deploys used to take two people four hours to complete. I wrote a plethora of scripts to automate this process: one for NetScaler load balancing, another that restarted all the services for each server role in the correct order, a health check script, and a wrapper script that encompassed all of these. The deploy process now takes one person 45 minutes, and most of that is just waiting for a service to build an index. Similarly for OS updates, I wrote a wrapper script that used my restart and health check scripts to automatically perform updates for an entire environment instead of updating servers individually. Regarding on-call issues, I wrote a "clean up" script with role-based rules. With it, I was able to reduce our free space alerts from an average of 55 per month to 5 per month. The NOC (the team that escalates alerts to our team) gave me kudos as well - they had a similar reduction in alerts.</p>
      <p>Researching and building proofs of concept was one of the most challenging aspects of my job. Before the AWS project began, I was tasked with creating a POC for a new build and life cycle management process using Red Hat Satellite (which is essentially Foreman and Katello). Satellite was fairly complex, and, due to it's rigid nature, it didn't work well for our environments, so that project was scrapped. I also researched several monitoring solutions, recommended Sensu, and ended up building POCs for Zabbix and Zenoss. Unfortunately, this was during a turbulent time for our company, so the monitoring projects were abandoned as well.</p>
      <p>Telecommuting was excellent! This was my first 100% remote/telecommuting position. Initially it was amazing to be able to focus on a project with almost no interruptions for hours at a time. As I got more popular, and started working with more teams, meetings began to chip away at the large blocks of contiguous time. Conveniently, we adopted an Agile methodology around the same time, so our monolithic projects were broken down into succinct stories. With frequent video conferencing and screen sharing, I was able to effectively work with my team across town, across the country, and globally. Despite having no office, I trained three new U.S. colleagues as well as two in Chennai, India. That being said, I am looking for an excuse to get a Tesla Model 3, so I'm willing to schlep into an office somewhere, gorge myself on free snacks, and socialize if the job requires it.</p>

<div class="left">Systems Administrator at <a href="http://www.indeed.com/">Indeed, Inc.</a> (Austin, TX)</div>
<div class="right">2013-11-25 to 2015-05-21<span class="years" data-start-date="2013-11-25" data-end-date="2015-05-21"></span></div>
<div class="clear">
      <p>As a member of the Operations team, I supported around 1,200 CentOS 6 servers in 10 data centers around the world. I worked with RackSpace, SoftLayer, AWS, as well as in a local data center in Austin, where the bulk of our servers resided.</p>
      <p>During a typical week, I worked with: Puppet with MCollective and Hiera using a YAML back end, Tomcat servers with Apache front ends load balanced with mod_jk or F5 BigIP LTMs, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Citrix XenServer, PagerDuty, Nagios, a Confluence wiki, Jira, Datadog monitoring and performance analysis, Dynect DNS and anycast load balancing, Cobbler, Jenkins, Rundeck, and Git... all pretty typical DevOps products and services.</p>
      <p>Documentation is great! When I started, we had many conflicting and outdated documents. When I left, we still had most of those... but we also had many fantastic docs for important processes such as: provisioning and decommissioning servers, deploying internal applications, load balancing, and DNS configuration.</p>
      <p>Regarding the "dev" side of DevOps, I had many scripting projects. Here are a few notable ones: fixing all deprecated variable references in our Puppet ERB templates, working around an infuriating design flaw by making logical volume configuration ignore inconsistent hard drive partitioning, and provisioning the majority of our business continuity data center by creating and plugging an inventory script into a Cobbler/XenServer script.</p>
      <p>I have a T-shirt that says, "Let me drop everything and work on your problem." It's supposed to be sarcastic, but I interpreted it literally instead. I officially supported several teams of developers at Indeed; I attended our weekly meetings, collaborated with them to solve problems, etc. But, due to the fact that I was usually the first ops person to show up in the morning, I unofficially supported everybody - I often dropped everything to work on their problems until the rest of my team arrived.</p>
      <p>When there were no fires to put out, I would switch roles to Data Janitor or Technical Debt Collector. I did a lot of code maintenance and auditing in what little free time I had. Notable projects were: using a script to find and reclaim unused LVs to free up space on our SAN; simplifying, compacting, refactoring, or just deleting old code, scripts, and documentation; and programmatically auditing our missing or wrong DNS PTR records.</p>
