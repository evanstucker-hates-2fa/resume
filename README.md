Are you in here reading my source code! That's fantastic!

For as long as I can remember, my resume has been this terrifying XML document that used XSL transformations to convert it to an XHTML 1.0 file. Lotta Xs. I finally decided to upgrade it. Now I'm using easy-to-read YAML file for data, and some basic Ruby code to generate it. One might ask why I generate it using code at all. My answer to that is that I am a **systems administrator**! I automate everything! You can search and replace words or snippets in a doc, but if you decide to change the layout, it's a hassle. With this code, I can just change the template and re-generate it... But really, I just like to write code.
