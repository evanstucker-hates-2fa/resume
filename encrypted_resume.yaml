biography: 'Evans Tucker is a hardened DevOps Engineer, probably best known for causing
  a brief company-wide outage, but occasionally recognized for his elegant code and
  excellent process documentation. He practices Agile software development using DevOps,
  Scrum, and Kanban methodologies. In 2015, he and his family sold almost everything
  they owned, and moved from Austin, Texas to Portland, Oregon to escape the heat,
  mosquitoes, and ennui. Evans is a strong advocate for: free and open source software;
  a decentralized, distributed web; autonomous electric cars; space colonization;
  and a post-scarcity economy where we can just sit around philosophizing all day
  long.'

  - ConsenSys is a global blockchain technology company building the infrastructure,
    applications, and practices that enable a decentralized world.  It was founded
    by Joe Lubin, who is also a co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain. Instead of
    a traditional hierarchy, it's comprised of a venture studio with over 50 autonomous
    startups; a few alignment circles that govern funding, HR, etc.; and an ever-changing
    list of other circles that host conferences, provide blockchain education, etc.
    It's a remote-first company based in New York with offices all around the world.
    I was hired at one of the startups within ConsenSys named Balanc3. Balanc3 provides
    financial management for digital assets like cryptocurrency and tokens.
  - When I started at Balanc3, I was given five Kubernetes clusters that the previous
    DevOps Engineer deployed to AWS with Terraform and some custom Ansible scripts.
    I quickly learned how to maintain these clusters and deploy new services to them.
    On the tenth business day of my employment, my predecessor handed me the admin
    keys and left Balanc3 to go back into the larger ConsenSys mesh, leaving me as
    the sole DevOps person for Balanc3. During my first year, I worked with ~20 developers
    in 3 countries to add ~20 services to our platform, roughly doubling the number
    of services when I first started.

  - Airswap: "“peer-to-peer trading through a suite of apps and tools that are free
      and easy to use.” Migrated some services to a new AWS account and new Kubernetes
      cluster."
  - Activate: "“buy, use, and manage your utility tokens.” Refined CI/CD pipelines,
      improved code auditing and security scanning."
  - Codefi: "“blockchain application suite powering commerce and finance.” Built new
      multi-tenant clusters and CI/CD pipelines in US and EU to support multiple teams
      and projects."
  - Assets: deployed new Kubernetes clusters and our Assets suite of applications
      for a real estate private equity platform.
  - Meridio: "“create and invest in shares of individual properties on the blockchain.”
      Migrated expensive AWS ECS clusters to Kubernetes. Deployed several whiteboxed
      versions of this platform for various clients."
  - Balanc3: "“financial management for digital assets.” Updated custom Ansible-based
      Kubernetes clusters to most popular community-supported tool at the time, kops.
      Also migrated all custom deployments to Helm. Significantly reduced the cost
      of the clusters as well by consolidating and performance tuning."

  - My team was working on GDPR and SOC 2 compliance, where my role was to automate
    the OS upgrade process for our Puppet, Sensu, Elasticsearch, and Jenkins hosts.
    Most notably, I wrote some scripts to control the flow of data into our Elasticsearch
    cluster, and perform a rolling upgrade. I also began deduplicating our collection
    of around forty separate copy/pasted upgrade scripts. I created a POC for a unified,
    generic upgrade process that would work with all of our hosts.
  - In addition to automation and upgrades, I experimented with Terraform as a way
    to manage our AWS IAM users and S3 buckets, but it wasn't quite the right tool
    for that job, so I ended up using AWS Config instead.
  reason_for_leaving: Philosophical differences with tenured coworkers. They wanted
    consistency, I wanted to innovate. I was formally reprimanded for creating a PR
    for a CSV file to replace our 40 deploy scripts.

  - For most of 2016, I was part of a small team that was creating a new platform
    in AWS. I built custom CentOS 7 and Oracle Linux 7 images using Packer, then we
    used SparkleFormation (an infrastructure as code (IaC) Ruby DSL that builds CloudFormation
    templates) to build ELBs, ASGs, and other BS. We set up GitLab to house all of
    the code, and used Puppet 4 with agent certificate extensions to manage our configuration.
  - 'App deploys, OS upgrades, developer requests, and on-call issues were another
    significant part of my workload. App deploys used to take two people four hours
    to complete. I wrote a plethora of scripts to automate this process: one for NetScaler
    load balancing, another that restarted all the services for each server role in
    the correct order, a health check script, and a wrapper script that encompassed
    all of these. The deploy process now takes one person 45 minutes, and most of
    that is just waiting for a service to build an index. Similarly for OS updates,
    I wrote a script to automatically perform updates for an entire environment instead
    of updating servers individually. Regarding on-call issues, I wrote a "clean up"
    script with role-based rules. With it, I was able to reduce our free space alerts
    from an average of 55 per month to 5 per month. The NOC (the team that escalates
    alerts to our team) gave me kudos as well - they had a similar reduction in alerts.'
  - Researching and building proofs of concept (POCs) was one of the most challenging
    aspects of my job. Before the AWS project began, I was tasked with creating a
    POC for a new build and life cycle management process using Red Hat Satellite
    (which is essentially Foreman and Katello). Satellite was fairly complex, and,
    due to it's rigid nature, it didn't work well for our environments, so that project
    was scrapped. I also researched several monitoring solutions, recommended Sensu,
    and ended up building POCs for Zabbix and Zenoss. Unfortunately, this was during
    a turbulent time for our company, so the monitoring projects were abandoned as
    well.
  - Telecommuting was excellent! This was my first 100% remote/telecommuting position.
    Initially it was amazing to be able to focus on a project with almost no interruptions
    for hours at a time. As I got more popular, and started working with more teams,
    meetings began to chip away at the large blocks of contiguous time. With frequent
    video conferencing and screen sharing, I was able to effectively work with my
    team across town, across the country, and globally. I even trained three new U.S.
    colleagues as well as two in Chennai, India. That being said, I am a social person,
    so I'm leaning slightly towards an office-based position for my next job.
  reason_for_leaving: Management did not prioritize maintenance, so tech debt just
    kept getting worse. Never got to attend training or conferences. Switched teams
    too many times, which was particularly difficult as a remote employee.

  - As a member of the Operations team, I supported around 1,200 CentOS 6 servers
    in 10 data centers around the world. I worked with RackSpace, SoftLayer, AWS,
    as well as in a local data center in Austin, where the bulk of our servers resided.
  - 'During a typical week, I worked with: Puppet with MCollective and Hiera using
    a YAML back end, Tomcat servers with Apache front ends load balanced with mod_jk
    or F5 BigIP LTMs, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Citrix XenServer, PagerDuty, Nagios, a Confluence
    wiki, Jira, Datadog monitoring and performance analysis, Dynect DNS and anycast
    load balancing, Cobbler, Jenkins, Rundeck, and Git... all pretty typical DevOps
    products and services.'
  - 'Documentation is great! When I started, we had many conflicting and outdated
    documents. When I left, we still had most of those... but we also had many fantastic
    docs for important processes such as: provisioning and decommissioning servers,
    deploying internal applications, load balancing, and DNS configuration.'
  - 'Regarding the "dev" side of DevOps, I had many scripting projects. Here are a
    few notable ones: fixing all deprecated variable references in our Puppet ERB
    templates, working around an infuriating design flaw by making logical volume
    configuration ignore inconsistent hard drive partitioning, and provisioning the
    majority of our business continuity data center by creating and plugging an inventory
    script into a Cobbler/XenServer script.'
  - I have a T-shirt that says, "Let me drop everything and work on your problem."
    It's supposed to be sarcastic, but I interpreted it literally instead. I officially
    supported several teams of developers at Indeed; I attended our weekly meetings,
    collaborated with them to solve problems, etc. But, due to the fact that I was
    usually the first ops person to show up in the morning, I unofficially supported
    everybody - I often dropped everything to work on their problems until the rest
    of my team arrived.
  - 'When there were no fires to put out, I would switch roles to Data Janitor or
    Technical Debt Collector. I did a lot of code maintenance and auditing in what
    little free time I had. Notable projects were: using a script to find and reclaim
    unused LVs to free up space on our SAN; simplifying, compacting, refactoring,
    or just deleting old code, scripts, and documentation; and programmatically auditing
    our missing or wrong DNS PTR records.'
  reason_for_leaving: Moved to Portland, Oregon. Tried to negotiate working remotely,
    but was unable to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

  - Built, upgraded, and repaired PC systems.
  - Provided tech support for hardware and software problems.
  fun_facts:
  - I actually got this job by opening the phone book, calling every computer store
    in town, and asking about open positions. As you can see, I didn't even get past
    "a" before I found work. I was pretty proud of myself for being so assertive.
  - This was the best job interview I ever had. I came in and the guy just gave me
    a PC with about thirty things wrong with it and said, "fix it". There were jumpers
    in the wrong position, partially inserted cards, cables plugged in backwards,
    bent pins, etc. I got it working pretty quickly and he hired me on the spot.
  reason_for_leaving: Found a better position at Texas.Net.
